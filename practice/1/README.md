Practice 1: Drawing Points in a Pattern

Goal: Practice initializing a WebGL context, writing simple shaders, and rendering points.

Objective:
Create an HTML page with one <canvas> that draws a series of colored points forming your initials or a constellation pattern (e.g., “Orion’s Belt”). Each point should have a different color, controlled by the fragment shader.
