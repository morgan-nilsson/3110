Practice 5: Nested Hexagons and Triangles

Goal: Generate geometry and apply transformations.

Draw nested hexagons alternating with equilateral triangles.

Allow the user to change the number of nesting levels (at least 6).

Continuously rotate the entire pattern around the Z-axis.

Each shape level should have a different color.
