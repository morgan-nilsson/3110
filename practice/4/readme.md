Practice 4: Interactive Shader Toggle

Goal: Add interactivity and event handling.

Objective:
Use two canvases, each with its own shader.

Canvas 1: On each click, toggle between two color modes — e.g., warm (red/orange) and cool (blue/purple).

Canvas 2: On each pair of clicks, draw a line connecting those points.
