Practice 6: Parametric Rose Curve (Polar Spiral Variant)

Goal: Practice parametric drawing and gradient color transitions.

Objective:
Draw a rose curve (also called a rhodonea curve) defined by
r(θ) = cos(kθ)
where k controls the number of petals.

The curve should have a smooth color gradient from center to edge.

Provide user input to change the value of k.

Continuously rotate around the Y-axis.
