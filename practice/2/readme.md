Practice 2: Multiple Canvases with Different Point Patterns

Goal: Work with multiple WebGL contexts.

Objective:
Extend your previous code to include two canvases:

Canvas 1: Draw points forming a heart shape.

Canvas 2: Draw points forming a spiral or polygon outline.

Each canvas should have its own WebGL context and its own vertex buffers.
