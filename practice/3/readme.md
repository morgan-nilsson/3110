Practice 3: Multiple Shader Programs

Goal: Learn to use different shaders for different visual effects.

Objective:
Create two canvases again, but this time:

Canvas 1: Use a solid color shader (single color for all points).

Canvas 2: Use a position-based gradient shader that colors points based on their x and y coordinates (e.g., r = abs(x), g = abs(y), b = 0.5).
